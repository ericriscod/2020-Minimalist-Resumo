        <p>
          I led the merger of our combined products, customer experience,
          systems, culture, and collaborative design process in a successful
          merger via acquisition from Spring 2019 to Fall 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social media today is centered around sharing your experiences with
          your followers and “connecting” with people via digital engagement. As
          a result, people are consumed by their phones and using digital to
          replace real-life experiences. At Twenty our mission is to enable and
          enrich experiences by bringing people together. I own, manage, and
          coach our teams towards solutions which help bring people together by
          increasing moments of serendipity.

        <p>
          I drove the introduction, influence, and scale of our internal design
          operations, while ensuring that we matured the design capabilities of
          our broader product team.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times I led from the front by designing as an IC for Mappen's
          product experiences which included our mobile apps, marketing, and
          various brand touch points. Responsible for taking ideas from
          conception to production while continuosly improving design operations
          for both the design, product, and engineering teams.

          I worked with copywriters, data scientists, content and email
          marketers, brand designers, developers, PR, community managers,
          product and program managers to drive our internal design operations
          in building a design-led culture so that we could have an expansive
          decision making framework when designing our various product marketing
          web experiences at scale. I led the creation of our internal web
          design system.
